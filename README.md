## Calculating QRP Transmitter Output Power  

The test setup required to perfrom transmitter output power measurement is depicted in 
section "Measurement Results".

Depending on RF probe type, formulas used to calculate output power differ slightly.

In this section we will consider half-wave rectifier and full-wave rectifier (prototyped) probes.

In case of both designs we start with generic Power equations (we assume dummy load to be fully 
resistive in nature for all frequencies for which power measurements are conducted). We also assume
that measurements are done using only carrier frequency (unmodulated signal). In case of voice radio
such test signal is generated by pushing PTT button in total silence.

$P=U*I$

knowing that $R=U/I$, we can express current as: $I=U/R$, which when plugged into power equation above
gives us:

$P=U^2/R$

### Half-Wave Rectifier Probe Formulas

RF probe output voltage can be expressed as:

$Umeas=Upeak - Uf$, where Uf is voltage drop on single diode (in case of BAT46 Uf=0.45V)

from above equation Upeak can be calculated as:

$Upeak=Umeas+Uf$

Max power can be expressed as:

$Pmax=Upeak^2/R$

which gives:

$Pmax=(Umeas+Uf)^2/R$

Similarly, RMS power can be expressed as:

$Urms=Upeak/\sqrt(2)$, hence:

$Urms^2=Upeak^2/2$

$Prms=Upeak^2/2R$

$Prms=(Umeas+Uf)^2/2R$

### Full-Wave Rectifier Probe Formulas

RF probe output voltage can be expressed as:

$Umeas=2(Upeak - Uf)$, where Uf is voltage drop on single diode (in case of BAT46 Uf=0.45V)

from above equation Upeak can be calculated as:

$Upeak=(Umeas+2Uf)/2$

Max power can be expressed as:

$Pmax=(Umeas+2Uf)^2/4R$

Similarly, RMS power can be expressed as:

$Urms=Upeak/\sqrt(2)$, hence:

$Urms^2=Upeak^2/2$

$Prms=Upeak^2/2R$

$Prms=(Umeas+2Uf)^2/8R$


### Measurement results

The test setup required to perfrom transmitter output power measurement:


Transmitter: TYT MD-790 set to low and high power settings
Dummy load: 50ohm resistor (RFR 50-250)
Osciloscope: Unit-T UTD2152CL

#### Radio power set to low

Umeas = 10V
R = 50ohm
Uf = 0.45V

$Pmax=(Umeas+2Uf)^2/4R=(10+0.9)^2/(4*50)=119/200=0.6W$

$Prms=(Umeas+2Uf)^2/8R=(10+0.9)^2/(8*50)=119/400=0.3W$

#### Radio power set to high

Umeas = 30V
R = 50ohm
Uf = 0.45V

$Pmax=(Umeas+2Uf)^2/4R=(31+0.9)^2/(4*50)=955/200=4.8W$

$Prms=(Umeas+2Uf)^2/8R=(31+0.9)^2/(8*50)=955/400=2.4W$

#### Measurements Conclusions

Chinese vendors routinly specify transmit power as maximum power output Pmax...
In case of measured TYT MD-790, TYT user manual specifies transmit power 
of <5W for high power setting <1W for low power setting.

From conducted measurements it is evident that manual refers to Pmax and not 
to commonly used and more applicable Prms...
